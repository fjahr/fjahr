The third Bitcoin halving is coming up quickly as I write this.
I thought this would be a great time to write down what I
learned about the amount of BTC in the UTXO set. Everyone
is talking about coin supply at the moment but detailed,
granular information
on this topic seemed to be hard to find.
Strangely, I only found this
[excellent StackExchange answer by Pieter Wuille](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/a/38998/83363)
very late into writing this article and there is a lot of overlap.
If you like this post I recommend
you read Pieter's as well since it basically approaches the same question
from the angle of future total coin supply and it's a quick read.

My insights on the current coin supply and the UTXO set mostly stem from
my work on [#18000](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/18000).
There I am working on an index for coin statistics
with the main goal to make the [RPC command](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/24163/what-does-the-bitcoin-rpc-mean-and-how-is-it-used) `gettxoutsetinfo` faster. Even much earlier before
starting the work on [#18000](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/18000),
I remember being thrown off by `gettxoutsetinfo`
because of the `total_amount`. To my surprise, it was a
very crocket number and that has not changed. At the
time of this analysis, the blockheight is `629038` and the `total_amount`
reported is `18362804.82079165`.

This is weird because one of the first things most people learn about
Bitcoin is that supply is pre-determined through the inflation schedule.
It prescribes that the block rewards were 50 BTC initially, then 25 BTC,
currently still 12.5 BTC. So the number should be evenly divisible by 12.5 theoretically but it is
clearly not. In short, the reason for that discrepancy is that `gettxoutsetinfo` does
not report the theoretical number of the inflation schedule but the actual
number of unspent coins that the node knows about.
Among others, the most intuitive reason for
this is to save disc space.
If these unspendable outputs would not be removed they could bloat the
UTXO set and take up disc space on every full node, forever.

## The UTXO set

I want to briefly recap what the
UTXO set (unspent transaction output set) is and why it exists to make
a bit more sense of what is coming next.
You probably know that Bitcoin
has a blockchain and that every (fully-validating) node in the network is validating
the whole blockchain. Simply put, the UTXO set is both the product
of that validation process and helps speed it up as well. Each Bitcoin
transaction has outputs and all non-coinbase transactions
consume previous outputs as inputs. Outputs can only be spent once
and need to be spent in full. If that is not the case a transaction,
and a block that contains such a transaction, is invalid.
For every valid block in
the chain, all the unspent outputs created in a block are written
into a database, the UTXO set. At the same time, every output
that gets consumed by a transaction in a block as an input is considered spent and gets
removed from the UTXO set.
The UTXO set helps to speed up the transaction validation
processes considerably since it gives a very quick overview of all
the outputs that are valid and can be spent.

Now, the RPC `gettxoutsetinfo` iterates over
all these unspent outputs in the database and aggregates the total
amount. One might say, `getutxosetinfo` would have been
the better name to match today's widely used terminology.
But as we already established earlier, there seems to be
some kind of a 'leak' since it reflects fewer bitcoins than expected.

So many many coins are lost exactly and where are they?
During my initial search for
the answer, [I only found some high-level ideas](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5220871.0)
but not a detailed analysis
of this. That's what I am trying to provide here.

## The amount of missing coins

The Bitcoin supply schedule started with 50 BTC for every new block,
with the reward halving every `210,000` blocks. That means we should currently
have:

```
210000 * 50 + 210000 * 25 + ((629038 + 1) - 420000) * 12.5
= 10500000 + 5250000 + 2612987.5
= 18362987.5 BTC
```

Where does the +1 come from? It's the Genesis block which is special
because it is hardcoded into the codebase and located at index 0 of
the blockchain. It also has a coinbase reward.

So we are missing exactly:
```
18362987.5 - 18362804.82079165 = 182.67920835 BTC
```

## Finally, where did these coins go?

### Genesis Block

We just added it in with the +1 in the last paragraph
and now we are taking it out
again. Well, this post is about going into the details
so it would be wrong to ignore this.

The [Genesis block](https://blockstream.info/block/000000000019d6689c085ae165831e934ff763ae46a2a6c172b3f1b60a8ce26f)
has [a coinbase reward](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/b549cb1bd2cc4c6d7daeccdd06915bec590e90ca/src/chainparams.cpp#L106)
but it is not spendable,
and that's why it also not part of the UTXO set. It is not spendable because
Satoshi's implementation is [skipping the Genesis block in validation](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/b549cb1bd2cc4c6d7daeccdd06915bec590e90ca/src/validation.cpp#L1960),
meaning it is also not adding the coinbase output to the UTXO set. They probably
did this because block validation generally includes checking that
the block has a valid ancestor, the previous block in the chain, as well. And
if they had not skipped validation altogether they would have needed
to code a special exception there which would have been more
difficult. But that is speculation.

```
182.67920835 - 50 = 132.67920835 BTC
```
Status: **132.67920835 BTC still missing!**

### BIP 30

[BIP 30](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0030.mediawiki)
describes a bug from the early days of Bitcoin. It turned out
that there was no measure against duplicate transaction ids (TXIDs) in the earlier
versions of Bitcoin. This was
probably overlooked because a normal user can not simply create a
transaction with a specific TXID. Each transaction depends,
among other things,
on the TXIDs of the outputs it spends. Since the TXID is a
SHA256 hash and the previous TXIDs
make it's content unique, achieving a duplicate
id would require the user to find a hash collision in SHA256,
breaking one of the main security assumptions in Bitcoin itself.

But there is an exception to that. Coinbase transactions don't have
parent tx's, so their input is all zeros, which means the content of the
SHA256 hash is not necessarily unique. So, unfortunately, a duplicate
coinbase transaction id used to be both possible and valid and it happened twice in bitcoins
history before it could be fixed:

- [Block 91722](https://blockstream.info/block/00000000000271a2dc26e7667f8419f2e15416dc6955e5a6c6cdf3f2574dd08e) coinbase TXID is repeated in [Block 91880](https://blockstream.info/block/00000000000743f190a18c5577a3c2d2a1f610ae9601ac046a38084ccb7cd721)
- [Block 91812](https://blockstream.info/block/00000000000af0aed4792b1acee3d966af36cf5def14935db8de83d6f9306f2f) coinbase TXID is repeated in [Block 91842](https://blockstream.info/block/00000000000a4d0a398161ffc163c503763b1f4360639393e0e4c8e300e0caec)

The implementation of BIP 30 in the Bitcoin Core code base still has
the [overriding blocks hardcoded into the codebase](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/b549cb1bd2cc4c6d7daeccdd06915bec590e90ca/src/validation.cpp#L2014).

The reason why this is a problem may not be completely obvious but the
term 'transaction ID' gives a hint. TXIDs also serve as the identifier for
coins that are stored in the UTXO set. In this case, an
existing output of the last coinbase got overridden by the next tx with
the same TXID. I previously mentioned that this was an oversight (pretty much
all software bugs are, I guess) but it is not completely clear to me by whom.
User piotr_n suggested in [his Bitcointalk post from 2014](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=216938.msg7182670#msg7182670)
that this bug was not introduced by
Satoshi and instead appeared after the switch from BerkeleyDB to LevelDB. I
have not fully verified this claim but it seems plausible.

As a fix, transactions with TXIDs that are already present in the UTXO set, i.e. that have
existed before and still have unspent outputs, [are declared invalid](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/b549cb1bd2cc4c6d7daeccdd06915bec590e90ca/src/validation.cpp#L2084).
TXIDs can reappear but only after all outputs have been spent.
But the rewards of the two overridden
coinbase transactions mentioned above were lost forever. Since the block
subsidy was 50 BTC at the time, that's 100 BTC lost.

```
132.67920835 - 100 = 32.67920835 BTC
```
Status: **32.67920835 BTC still missing!**

By the way, the more long term fix for this issue was implemented with
[BIP34](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0034.mediawiki).
It prescribed the introduction of a new block version (v2) which
[required coinbase transactions to start with the height of the current block](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/7bcc42b4035b878719d13201286e322989b415c5/src/validation.cpp#L3542).
Since this part made coinbase transactions unique it is now virtually
impossible to introduce a duplicate coinbase transaction
by accident.


### OP_RETURN

For somewhat more experienced bitcoin users this opcode might come to mind
first when they think of unspendable or 'burned' outputs.
Producing those is the whole purpose of OP_RETURN. Yes, the use of OP_RETURN means that
the output is automatically marked invalid and cannot be spent anymore.
Because of that, these outputs are also [not included in the UTXO set](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/b549cb1bd2cc4c6d7daeccdd06915bec590e90ca/src/script/script.h#L536).

Looking at the blockchain I found `3.72417931 BTC` have been "burned" with the use
of OP_RETURN. That number still expands steadily, by the way, so the
OP_RETURN opcode is still frequently used. I imagine services like
[OpenTimestamps](https://opentimestamps.org/) are responsible for
most of it today.

```
32.67920835 - 3.72417931 = 28.955029039 BTC
```
Status: **28.95502904 BTC still missing!**


### Script too large

Another reason for an output to be [marked as not spendable](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/b549cb1bd2cc4c6d7daeccdd06915bec590e90ca/src/script/script.h#L536)
in the
future is a script size that is too large. The threshold
is defined in `MAX_SCRIPT_SIZE` and set to 10000 bytes.

I did not find evidence of any specific cases of this, but since
the rule was explicit in the code, I figured I should look into
it. But it appears there were no coins that were excluded from the
UTXO set specifically for this reason.

Status: **28.95502904 BTC still missing!**


### Unclaimed Miner Rewards

This may sound weird at first, but there is a possibility that miners
don't claim their full block reward in a block they mined. The mining
reward in the coinbase transaction is not checked against a specific
value but rather to [not exceed the valid block reward](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/b549cb1bd2cc4c6d7daeccdd06915bec590e90ca/src/validation.cpp#L2190).
So a block with a reward smaller than the sum of the current
block subsidy and the total fees would still be valid.
But for a miner who has mined a block with a smaller reward,
there is also no way to claim these funds later.
After the block is included in the
blockchain these coins are also lost forever and will never
appear in the UTXO set.

Why would a miner do this? I can not think of any good reason, it
seems much more likely that this is always the result of a bug.

Thankfully Pieter Wuille lists some known incidents in his
[StackExchange answer](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/a/38998/83363)
saving me from writing more custom code and
hours of research:

> - Block 124724 tried to intentionally claim 0.00000001 BTC less than allowed, but accidentally also failed to claim the fees, losing 0.01000001 BTC.
> - Between block 162705 and block 169899, 193 blocks claimed less than allowed due to a bug, resulting in a total loss of 9.66184623 BTC.
> - Between block 180324 and block 249185, another 836 blocks claimed less than allowed, resulting in a total loss of 0.52584193 BTC.
> - Block 501726 had no transaction outputs (except a 0-value commitment), losing the entire 12.5 BTC subsidy.
> - Block 526591 didn't claim half of the block reward, losing 6.25 BTC.

Pieter describes a loss of `28.94768817 BTC` in his answer. I found a few
more satoshis that miners lost, most likely by miscalculating the
total fee. My analysis showed `28.95502904 BTC` went missing this
way, which is `734087 sats` more than Pieter accounted for.

```
28.95502904 - 28.95502904 = 0 BTC
```
Status: **0 BTC still missing!**


### Other unspendable outputs

These are not all the outputs that are known to be unspendable.
There are several more types of outputs that are impossible to
spend (see the [list in this BitcoinTalk post](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=675321.0)
by user DeathAndTax for example). However, these are still included in the UTXO
set.
An update on the numbers of these other unspendable outputs would certainly be
interesting as well.

## Final thoughts

![Missing coins distribution](/gettxoutsetinfo_missing_coins_distribution.svg)

Pfew, I am really happy that worked out evenly at the end ;)
So now you know why the `total_amount` is not the number
you probably expected at first. I found it very satisfying to
explore these internals of Bitcoin Core, especially
because it had been an open question for me from the very first time
I spun up a node. I hope you enjoyed reading this post as much
as I enjoyed figuring these things out and writing them down.

Special thanks to James, Max, Freerk, Felix and Elaine for reading and providing
feedback on an earlier version of this post.
